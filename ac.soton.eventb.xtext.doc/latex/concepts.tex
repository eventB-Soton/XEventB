\subsection{XText Projects}
\label{sec:xtext-projects}

Each project containing XEvent-B constructs must be set to be XText project.  An XText project has an associated XContext and XMachine builders that can compile XEvent-B source files into Rodin files as they are changed.  The builders can be turn off via the preferences, either workspace-wise or project-wise (see Figure~\ref{fig:XContextPreference}.

  \fi

\end{figure}

The XText projects must be organised such that all XEvent-B constructs has the project as the source container.

\subsection{XEvent-B Builders}
\label{sec:xevent-b-builders}
The XEvent-B Builders, i.e., XContext builder and XMachine builder, build XEvent-B constructs, i.e., XContext and XMachine using their own compiler.  If they are enabled, the XEvent-B builders are run everytime an individual XEvent-B file is saved.  Problems detected by the XEvent-B builders are classified as either warnings or errors.  Compile-time errors are always reported as errors by the XEvent-B buiders and in the presence of errors, no new Rodin files are created or updated, i.e., the XEvent-B builders do not produce any new Rodin file content.

\subsection{Content Assist}
\label{sec:content-assist}
Content assist are available for typesetting keywords and Event-B mathematical symbols. The short-cut for invoking content assist is \texttt{Ctrl+Space}.  Figure~\ref{fig:KeywordContentAssist} shows an example for content assist with keywords.

  \label{fig:KeywordContentAssist}
\end{figure}
For Event-B mathematical symbols, the key combination is defined by the Rodin Keyboard plug-in.
